Just shipped my portfolio site: **lukefournier.com**

Built it from scratch with Next.js, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

A few things I focused on:
→ Code-inspired aesthetic (because we're developers, right?)
→ Mobile-first responsive design
→ Clean bento grid layout
→ Subtle animations that don't distract

The whole thing is server-rendered, fast, and SEO-optimized.

**Here's the thing** — I genuinely enjoyed building this more than I expected.

So if you're a developer, designer, or anyone who needs a portfolio site but doesn't have time to build one yourself, I'd love to help.

Seriously. DM me. Let's talk.
